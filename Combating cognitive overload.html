					<h1>Combating cognitive overload</h1>
				</header>
			
				<h2 id="content">Overview</h2>
				<h3>Outline</h3>
				<p>The course is a microlearning course based around a scenario for the learner to solve. Cognitive overload is a common phenomenon in the workplace impacting employee performance, engagement and productivity. A high volume of information supply and demand is one of the main causes of burnout in the workplace, impacting the health and well-being of employees, detrimentally impacting company performance. </p>

				
				Audience: Managers
				<p> Responsibilities: Instructional Design, Action Mapping, Storyboarding, Visual Design, Mockups, eLearning Development
					<br>Tools Used: Articulate Storyline, Articulate rise, Figma, Mindmeister, PowerPoint, Artificial intelligence: Heygen, Elevenlabs.

					
					

				<h3>Problem</h3>
				<p>The scenario involves an employee showing symptoms of cognitive overload, and the manager is required to intervene effectively, as well as manage the next project to reduce the effects of cognitive overload.  </p>
				<h3>Solution</h3>
				<p>To provide managers with an understanding of cognitive overload, how it impacts the brainsâ€™ ability to process information effectively and the symptoms that it causes. For managers to be aware of strategies to manage projects to reduce the effects of cognitive overload, to improve employee productivity and performance, as well as being able to identify signs of cognitive overload in employees, so that they can intervene appropriately to provide support. </p>

				<h4>Artificial intelligence</h4>
					<p>AI generated avatar was used within this course, to create an animation to introduce each lesson. The script communicated by the avatar included questions around scenarios and events in the workplace on the area to be covered. This gave real world context to the information that would be covered within the lesson and an opportunity for the learner to "think" and "reflect". The avatar was programmed to communicate the script in the English language using an American accent. Furthermore, a presentation was generated in the background to support the information communicated by the avatar to emphasise key areas. </p>

				</p><p>Also, AI generated audios were programmed to support explanation of visuals, including flow diagrams and graphs. The speed of the voice over was adjusted, to maximise learning and understanding, so that the learner could sequentially refer to the visual as they listened to the audio.</p>
